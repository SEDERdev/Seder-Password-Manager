Hi everyone,

This is my first project, and I'm using it as an opportunity to learn and grow. As a result, the code might be a bit messy, but I'm eager to improve. If you have any suggestions, I'd love to learn from your experience.

The project is a password manager that allows you to input an application name, username, and either input a password or generate one. Here are some areas I'm looking to improve:

GUI Enhancements: Currently, the GUI is implemented using the pack layout feature. I know it can be made much more visually appealing using a grid. I will look into this soon.

Master Password: I plan to add a master password feature to secure the app upon opening.

Security Enhancements: After adding the master password, my next step is to encrypt the CSV file where the passwords are stored, as well as the master password itself for added security.

I'm open to any suggestions or feedback you may have. Thanks for stopping by and helping me improve my project!
